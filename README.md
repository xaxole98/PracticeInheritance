# PracticeInheritance
Practice of Inheritance and Polymorphism in Java
This project is a practice of the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism in the Java programming language. The project consists of a class called Person, which represents a person with a first and last name. From this class are derived two other classes called Employee and Manager, which represent people who work in a company. The Employee class has an attribute called salary, which indicates the employee's monthly salary. The Manager class has an attribute called bonus, which indicates the manager's annual bonus.

The project also contains a class called Main, which contains the main method of the program. In this method, an array of objects of type Person is created, assigned a random first name, last name, and a random salary or bonus, and their information is displayed on the screen. This is an example of polymorphism, since objects in derived classes can be treated as if they were from the base class, and the appropriate method is called based on the actual type of the object.

How to run the project
To run the project you need to have Java installed and an IDE like Eclipse or NetBeans. You must clone or download the repository from GitHub and open it in the IDE. The Main class must then be executed as a Java application.

Author
The author of the project is xaxole98, a student learning Java who created this project for the purpose of practicing polymorphism and inheritance. The author acknowledges that he did not understand all of the code, but that he at least made some progress.

I hope this readme.md file is useful to you. If you want to improve your code, I suggest using comments to explain what each line or method does, and using more descriptive names for variables and parameters. You can also use more consistent formatting for your code, such as correctly indenting and using spaces between operators. These are good programming practices that will help you write more readable and maintainable code. ðŸ˜Š
